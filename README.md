# Celestial_Bodies_Database_PostgreSQL

This is a freecodecamp Relational Database certification project

# Instructions

For this project, you need to log in to PostgreSQL with psql to create your database. Do that by entering psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres in the terminal. Make all the tests below pass to complete the project. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!

Don't forget to connect to your database after you create it 😄

Here's some ideas for other column and table names: description, has_life, is_spherical, age_in_millions_of_years, planet_types, galaxy_types, distance_from_earth.

# Project Requirements

You should create a database named universe

Be sure to connect to your database with \c universe. Then, you should add tables named galaxy, star, planet, and moon

Each table should have a primary key

Each primary key should automatically increment

Each table should have a name column

You should use the INT data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key

You should use the NUMERIC data type at least once

You should use the TEXT data type at least once

You should use the BOOLEAN data type on at least two columns

Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in galaxy

Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in star

Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in planet

Your database should have at least five tables

Each table should have at least three rows

The galaxy and star tables should each have at least six rows

The planet table should have at least 12 rows

The moon table should have at least 20 rows

Each table should have at least three columns

The galaxy, star, planet, and moon tables should each have at least five columns

At least two columns per table should not accept NULL values

At least one column from each table should be required to be UNIQUE

All columns named name should be of type VARCHAR

Each primary key column should follow the naming convention table_name_id. For example, the moon table should have a primary key column named moon_id

Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing
